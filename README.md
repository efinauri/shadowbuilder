A project aiming to build Shadowverse decks through a genetic algorithm. The goal and challenge is to implement an evaluation function whose fitness value is the winrate against human made decks, making use of a (sensibly) playing AI.

## Usage
GNU/Linux and Windows executables are provided.

## TODO
- A simulation framework for the AI to play in.
- Hardcoding cards for being handled by the above framework.
- A playing AI to play with the above cards.
- A winrate based evaluation function using the above AI.
